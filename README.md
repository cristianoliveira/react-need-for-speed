# React to the need for speed
My talk about metrics, analyse, tools and best practices for performance optimisation in React.

### Abstract

Let's face a fact we don't really care that much about performance till it's too late. We work with top-notch machines within the latest CPU processor + 16 GB + fast internet so we don't actually experience our apps as our users do. So that page that you noticed performing badly in the last week, sorry to be the one to tell you, but for your users, it has been like it for much longer.

In this talk, I will discuss some of the strategies we can apply for preventing, measuring, debugging and fixing some of the most common performance issues in the react world.

### Takeaways

- When should we care about performance? Because: "Premature optimisation is the root of all evil"
- How to approach measuring and metrics?
- Tools for measuring and Automating these validations.
- Understanding the reconciliation and why bad practices hurt it's algorithm
- Best practices for React and it's relation with DOM
- What is new on React for performance optimisation debugging
- Real cases at SumUp. (I'll try to kill 2 birds with one stone) :D
- Demo
