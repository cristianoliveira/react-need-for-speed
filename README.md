# React to the need for speed
A talk about metrics, analyse, tools and best practices for performance optimisation in React.

### Abstract

Let's face it: We don't really care that much about performance till it's too late. Why does this happen? Well, we work with top-notch machines with the latest CPU and 16GB of memory + fast internet which means we don't actually experience our apps as our users do. Do you know that page we noticed rendering slowly only in the last week? Spoiler alert: For the users, it has been like this since they signed up (if they did).

In this talk, the audience will walk away with a better understanding of why we have some best practices and how to debug performance in their React apps using modern tools, based on real-life examples and common pitfalls.

### Takeaways

- How did we get here?
- Performance in the Front end world?
- When should we care about performance? Because: "Premature optimisation is the root of all evil"
- How to approach measuring and metrics?
- Tools for measuring and automating performance budgets.
- Understanding the reconciliation and why bad practices hurt its algorithm
- Best practices for React and it's relation with DOM
- What is new on React for performance optimisation debugging
- Real cases at SumUp of performance optmization: what we did right and wrong? Common pitfalls.
- Demo Let's apply the concepts in a real app! (Because why not?)
